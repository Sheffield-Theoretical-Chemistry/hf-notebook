# HF Notebook

A jupyter notebook that demonstrates a Hartree-Fock calculation on a two electron system (defaults to HeH+)

## Getting Started

This can be run on either a local Jupyer install, or you may be interested in using it with binder
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Sheffield-Theoretical-Chemistry/hf-notebook/master?filepath=hf-heh.ipynb)

This notebook is designed to support a Quantum Chemistry course at the University of Sheffield.

## Acknowledgments

* Thanks to Robert Shaw for an initial implementation of the program in Python.
* Hat tip to Tristan Johnston-Wood for suggesting that it would be useful to see how the equations presented in the course are used in a calculation.
